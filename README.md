[Tableau Public Link - Citibike Analysis Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Module_14Challenge_16623219874910/CitibikeAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to paint a picture of the Citibike trip data that enhances our business proposal geared towards an audience of key stakeholders, 
more specifically:
- the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

Below are 7 key visualizations generated using our Citibike trip data. These visuals are aimed at addressing the relationships mentioned above:
1. August Peak Hours
2. Trips by Weekday
3. Checkout Times by Gender
4. User Trips by Gender by Weekday
5. Starting Locations by Customer Type
6. Checkout Times
7. Customer Types

**In general, we can hypothesize that ride data will show a relationship between the popular commute times ("rush hour"), and the amount of rides across all users.

1. August Peak Hours

We are able to see that the peak hours for rides during the month of August are around 8AM, 5PM and 6PM. The bar chart suggests many users may be using the citibike to commute to and from work.

2. Trips by Weekday

This heat map shows the same increase of rides around the times of 8AM, 5PM and 6PM but gives the audience the granularity of weekday, showing more rides during rush hour on the weekdays, and less rides during rush hour on the weekends.

3. Checkout Times by Gender

The image shows a dashboard with a breakdown of the relationships found where Gender is a factor. In other words, this dashboard suggests differences in usage based on Gender. For example, the Checkout Times by Gender visualization suggests that Males may take longer rides than females and those who did not disclose their Gender.

4. User Trips by Gender by Weekday

![Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/jmalauss/bikesharing/blob/main/Gender%20Breakdown.png)

User Trips by Gender by Weekday shows the audience which users (customer or subscriber) ride the most on which weekday. This heatmap also adds Gender as an additional factor to add more detail. We can tell from this visualization that Subscribers, across all Genders, ride more than Customers. Additionally, we can see that Thursday is a popular day for riding for Subscribers across both Genders, although Males have more rides on Thursdays than Females. 

5. Starting Locations by Customer Type
